# Dimensional Reduction and Clustering (educational)
 
This project explores the following algorithms on different datasets:  
PCA  
LDA  
CCA  
ICA  
K-Means  
DP-Means  
GMM  


For each algorithm I have generated/ imported one 'good' dataset - where the algorithm is expected to do well and a 'bad'  
dataset - where the algorithm is expected to fail, to see how they will perform.  
Below are the results:
